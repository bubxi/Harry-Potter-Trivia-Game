#the game will give the player 5 lives. They need to correctly answer 10 questions that are randomly selected from a pool of say 30 questions.
#if they lose the game they have the option to start again (with new questions)
#if they win they get a score thats calculated based on how long it took them to complete all 10 questions. 
#for example, if getting through all 10 questions without any mistakes, they could score really high.
#if they lose lives and take a while, their score will reflect this.
#eg. lose a heart, lose 50 points, get a question right, win 200 points. 
#the game will list all your previous scores - keeping only the top 10 - this will be saved onto a text file for now (can maybe put it on a database later)
#the questions will also be collected from a text file



#if answer is correct = score + 200 points


#if answer is incorrect = score - 50 points. one live out of 5 is lost.



#read from file for question - make a check so that it doesnt ask the same question more than once
#need to make it so it loops until 10 questions have been answered
#cannot be the same question more than once
#will need to add error checking - ensure only letters a-d are entered, and convert capitals .lower to match the answer


#ask user for name so it saves the name next to their score
